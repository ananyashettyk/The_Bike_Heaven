# The_Bike_Heaven
The Bike Haven, a thriving bike shop in San Francisco, aims to enhance its online sales reports by transitioning from static reports to interactive dashboards. As a Business Intelligence Analyst, the goal is to create a visually interactive and informative dashboard that provides insights into the sales performance of the company.

Objective:
The objective of this project is to design and develop a Tableau dashboard that helps the sales manager, Chris, understand the sales figures better. The dashboard should provide a comprehensive overview of the sales performance, including product categories, top-selling products, top customers, sales figures vs. budget, and sales figures by region/city.

Dataset:
The dataset consists of 7 tables, including customer, sales, date, product, category, subcategory, and geography. The tables will be merged and preprocessed using SQL to create a comprehensive dataset for analysis.

Visualizations:
The dashboard will include the following visualizations:
- Top 10 Products by Sales Amount: A bar chart showing the top 10 products generating the most revenue for the company.
- Top 10 Customers: A bar chart identifying the most valuable customers, allowing for focused customer service and long-term relationships.
- Sales Figures vs. Budget: A chart or table comparing actual sales figures to budgeted sales figures for each month, highlighting areas for improvement.
- Sales Figures by Region/City: A map or chart showing sales figures by region, identifying regional trends and opportunities for growth.
- Product Categories vs. Sales Amount: A chart or graph providing an overview of how each product category is performing, highlighting areas for attention.
